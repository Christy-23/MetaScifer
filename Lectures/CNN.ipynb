    "##  Assignment: MNIST Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform handwritten digit classification using the **MNIST dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your CNN architecture must include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Three convolutional layers**, each with:\n",
    "  - **32 filters**\n",
    "  - **Kernel size: 3Ã—3**\n",
    "  - Suitable activation function (e.g., ReLU)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two Max Pooling layers** placed appropriately after convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Flatten** layer to convert feature maps into a 1D vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One or more **Dense (fully connected) layers**, including:\n",
    "  - An appropriate output layer for **multi-class classification** (10 classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a suitable **loss function**, **optimizer**, and **metrics** for model compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and preprocess** the MNIST dataset (normalization, reshaping, etc.).\n",
    "2. **Construct** the CNN model according to the architecture specified above.\n",
    "3. **Compile** the model using appropriate parameters.\n",
    "4. **Train** the model and display training/validation accuracy.\n",
    "5. **Evaluate** the model on the test data and report the final accuracy.\n",
    "6. Ensure your code is **well-commented and neatly organized**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit the complete **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** file.\n",
    "- Your notebook should include:\n",
    "  - All code cells with implementation.\n",
    "  - Markdown cells explaining each step and block of code.\n",
    "  - Final accuracy and observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " *Bonus (Optional): Try adding dropout or batch normalization and observe performance changes.*\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "### Required Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to use the following Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n",
